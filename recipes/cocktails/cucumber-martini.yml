directions:

  - step: Add the grapefruit bitters, dry vermouth, and gin to the mixing glass.
  - step: Fill mixing glass with enough crushed ice to completely cover the drink.
  - step: Use the bar spoon to stir the drink for 30 seconds to 1 minute, depending on desired temperature and dilution.
    note:
      When stirring, allow the back of the spoon to follow the wall of the glass mixing.
      The stirring action should be performed by the moving ice rather than by the bar spoon.
  - step: Use the julep strainer to separate the drink into the martini glass. Discard the ice.

      Cut a long, thick peel from the grapefruit. Twist it over the drink to infuse the oils.
      Garnish the drink by balancing the peel along the edge of the glass.
  - step:
      Slice a cucumber wheel from the english cucumber and add it as garnish.
      It may either be mounted onto the edge of the glass, or allowed to float on the surface of the drink.
